EVALUATION LICENSE AGREEMENT 
20190207-AW&F-CTELA

This Evaluation License Agreement (the “Agreement”) is a legal agreement between Analog Devices, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation, with its principal office at One Technology Way, Norwood, Massachusetts, USA 02062 (“Analog Devices”) and you (either an individual or a single entity) (“Licensee”) for the software and related documentation that accompanies this Agreement (the “Licensed Software”).   YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING OR USING THE SOFTWARE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY OR USE THE SOFTWARE.  

 
1. License.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Analog Devices grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to internally use the Licensed Software (and modify the Licensed Software if it is provided in source code form) for the sole purpose of evaluating the use of Licensed Software with Analog Devices’ processors / products.  The Licensed Software may not be used with any other processors / products or for any other purpose.  

2. Restrictions and Conditions.  The license granted in Section 1 is conditioned on full compliance with this Section 2 and the other obligations under this Agreement.  
(a) Licensee shall not modify, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or create derivative works of Licensed Software (except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted (i) pursuant to Section 1 above or (ii) by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation). 
(b) In no event shall Licensee (i) deliver or disclose the Licensed Software to any third party or (ii) use the Licensed Software in commercially available products. 
(c) Licensee shall not engage in any activities with respect to the Licensed Software that would cause Licensed Software, in whole or in part to become subject to any terms of an Excluded License.  An “Excluded License” means any license, including licenses for “open source” code (as defined by the Free Software Foundation), that requires as a condition of use, modification, and/or distribution of software subject to the Excluded License, that such software or other software combined and/or distributed with such software be (i) disclosed or distributed in source code form; (ii) licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or (iii) redistributable at no charge.  The restrictions of this section apply regardless of whether the Licensed Software is intended or designed to run in an environment that includes software under an Excluded License.  Any license, agreement or other document issued, entered into or granted by Licensee that purports to apply any Excluded License to any portion of Licensed Software shall be null and void with regard to Licensed Software.  
(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, Licensee may not use any trademark or trade name of Analog Devices or make any public announcement regarding the existence of this Agreement without Analog Devices’ prior written consent.  Licensee may not publish or provide the results of any benchmark or comparison tests run on the Licensed Software to any third party without the prior written consent of Analog Devices.  
(e) All rights not expressly granted in this Agreement are reserved to Analog Devices.
Any use of the Licensed Software for any purpose other than as expressly licensed hereunder is outside the scope of this Agreement.
(f) If Analog Devices elects to make any update, upgrade or new version of the Licensed Software (“Updates”) available to Licensee, such Updates shall be deemed to be Licensed Software under this Agreement.  If requested by Analog Devices, Licensee shall only use the latest version of the Licensed Software (including Updates).  Analog Devices shall have no obligation to provide support or Updates.
(g) Analog Devices and its suppliers (as applicable) shall retain all right, title and interest in Licensed Software and all derivative works thereof, including all related intellectual property rights in any of the foregoing.  Licensee shall not take any action inconsistent with such title and ownership.

Licensee agrees that all Feedback is and shall be given entirely voluntarily. To the extent Licensee provides such Feedback, however, Licensee hereby grants to Analog Devices and its affiliates a non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable license, with the right to sublicense, under Licensee’s intellectual property, to use and disclose Feedback in any manner Analog Devices or its affiliates choose, including without limitation displaying, performing, copying, making, having made, using, selling, and otherwise disposing of Analog Devices’ and its licensee’s products embodying such Feedback in any manner and via any media, without reference to its source or other obligation to Licensee and even if the Feedback is designated as confidential.
(i) In no event shall Licensee remove any copyright or other intellectual property notice or other legend contained on or in copies of Licensed Software or displayed by any Licensed Software.


3.  Confidentiality.  
(a) Licensed Software, any accompanying documentation, and any other information which a reasonable person would understand is of a confidential or proprietary nature,  shall be deemed to be “Confidential Information” of Analog Devices whether or not it is identified in writing as “Confidential.”  Analog Devices Confidential Information shall include without limitation software, documentation and information of Analog Devices’ affiliates, suppliers and licensors.  
(b) Licensee agrees to protect the confidentiality of Analog Devices Confidential Information, including without limitation Licensee agrees: (i) not to disclose or otherwise permit any other person or entity access to, in any manner, Confidential Information, or any part thereof in any form whatsoever, except that such disclosure or access shall be permitted to an employee of Licensee requiring access to Confidential Information in the course of his or her employment in connection with this Agreement and who is subject to written confidentiality obligations at least as protective with respect to Confidential Information as the terms and conditions in this Agreement and such employees comply with all other applicable provisions of this Agreement; (ii) to notify Analog Devices promptly and in writing of the circumstances surrounding any suspected possession, use or knowledge of Confidential Information other than those authorized by this Agreement; and (iii) not to use Confidential Information for any purpose other than as expressly authorized herein.
(c) Nothing in this Section 3 shall restrict Licensee with respect to information if such information:  (i) was rightfully possessed by Licensee before it was received from Analog Devices; (ii) is independently developed by Licensee without reference to Confidential Information; (iii) is subsequently furnished to Licensee by a third party not under any obligation of confidentiality with respect to such information, and without restrictions on use or disclosure; or (iv) is or becomes public or available to the general public otherwise than through any act or default of Licensee.
(d) Licensee acknowledges and agrees that any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information may cause Analog Devices substantial and irreparable damages and, therefore, in the event of any such unauthorized use or disclosure or threat of unauthorized use or disclosure, in addition to other remedies which may be available at law, Analog Devices shall be entitled to receive specific performance and other injunctive and equitable relief without the posting of any bond.  

4. Required Consents; Indemnification.  Licensee acknowledges that use of the Licensed Software may require Licensee to obtain licenses to intellectual property or other consents from one or more third parties.  Licensee is responsible for obtaining any and all such required licenses and consents regarding the Licensed Software. Without limitation, Licensee is responsible for maintaining and/or obtaining third party licenses in connection with any Industry Standard hereafter defined below (including related intellectual property rights) applicable to the Licensed Software.  "Industry Standard" means any standard, protocol or specification that is promulgated by any standards development organization, consortium, trade association, special interest group, or like group or entity, for the purpose of widespread adoption.  By way of non-limiting examples, industry standards and specifications may include without limitation technical specifications promulgated by organizations such as the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), International Standards Organization (ISO), International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), 3'd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), OpenFabncs Alliance, Open Mobile Alliance, UPnP Forum, USB lmplementers Forum, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), American National Standards Institute (ANSI), Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) and AUTomotive Open System Architecture (AUTOSAR). Licensee shall defend, indemnify and hold Analog Devices, its affiliates and suppliers, and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents (each an “Indemnified Party”) harmless from and against any damages, fines, penalties, assessments, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs) in the event that any claim is brought against an Indemnified Party arising or alleged to arise directly or indirectly from (i) Licensee’s possession, use or other exploitation of Licensed Software or (ii) Licensee’s failure to obtain any required license or consent with respect to the Licensed Software.  

5. Term and Termination.  
(a) The term of this license is for a period of six (6) months commencing on the date the Licensed Software is first received by Licensee from Analog Devices or its authorized distributor (“Term”).  This Agreement is effective until the expiration of the Term or until terminated in accordance with this Section.  Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time by giving written notice to the other party. This Agreement shall immediately automatically terminate in the event of any failure by Licensee to comply with any term or condition of the Agreement. In the event of termination, Licensee must permanently delete all copies of Licensed Software and all of its component parts, including any backup or archival copies.  The provisions of Sections 2 through 15 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement according to their terms.
(b) LICENSED SOFTWARE MAY BE TIME-SENSITIVE AND MAY NOT FUNCTION UPON EXPIRATION OF TERM.  NOTICE OF EXPIRATION WILL NOT BE GIVEN, SO LICENSEE NEEDS TO PLAN FOR THE EXPIRATION DATE.  In order to protect against unauthorized use of the Licensed Software in commercial applications, Analog Devices may have integrated copy protection into the evaluation software.  Typical protection may include a time-out or periodic beep on audio software or a watermark on imaging software.  

6. Disclaimers.  LICENSED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND ANALOG DEVICES HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED SOFTWARE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY; FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE; QUALITY AND ACCURACY OF INFORMATIONAL CONTENT; NON-INFRINGEMENT; QUIET ENJOYMENT; AND TITLE.  LICENSEE AGREES THAT ANY EFFORTS BY ANALOG DEVICES OR ITS AFFILIATES TO MODIFY OR UPDATE LICENSED SOFTWARE SHALL NOT BE DEEMED A WAIVER OF THESE LIMITATIONS.  

7.  Limitation of Liability.  
(a) ANALOG DEVICES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHETHER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF ANALOG DEVICES WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  IN NO EVENT SHALL ANALOG DEVICES’ CUMULATIVE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES TO LICENSEE FOR ANY AND ALL CAUSES WHATSOEVER, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ANY CLAIMS OR ACTIONS, EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100.00 U.S.).  ANALOG DEVICES’ AFFILIATES SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY WHATSOEVER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE LICENSED SOFTWARE OR ITS USE.
(b) Some jurisdictions do not permit the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, and, as such, some portion of the above limitation may not apply to Licensee.  In such jurisdictions, Analog Devices' liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

8. Choice of Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, United States of America, without reference to its principles of conflicts of laws, and, as to matters affecting copyrights, trademarks and patents, in addition, by applicable United States federal law.  The parties agree that the jurisdiction and venue of any action with respect to this Agreement shall be in a court of competent subject matter jurisdiction located in Boston, Massachusetts, and each of the parties hereby agrees to submit itself to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts for the purpose of any such action, except that Analog Devices may seek injunctive relief in any venue of its choosing. Licensee hereby submits to personal jurisdiction in such courts. The parties hereto specifically exclude the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act from this Agreement. The parties hereto waive any statute, law, or regulation that might provide an alternative law or forum or to have this Agreement written in any language other than English.

9. U.S. Government Restricted Rights. If Licensed Software or documentation provided by Analog Devices or its suppliers is procured by or on behalf of the United States Government, the Government agrees that such software or documentation is “commercial computer software” or “commercial computer software documentation” and that absent a written agreement to the contrary, the Government’s rights with respect to such Licensed Software or documentation are limited by the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to FAR § 12.212(a) and/or DFARS § 227.7202-1(a), as applicable.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICEN
Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,  in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]

                        Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.
        
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a     restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages        are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.
         
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".

 A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

 The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work  which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)

 "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.

 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.
          
 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
         
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

   b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 
   c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

   d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices.
         
 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
 
 This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.

 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

 If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

 However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

 When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object        file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

 Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
        
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

 You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one of these things:

  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under            Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)

  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,            rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is            interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
 
  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.

  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

 For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies        the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that youdistribute.
         
 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the            Sections above.

  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explainin where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or        distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
         
 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you        may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then        the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the        integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
         
 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                        NO WARRANTY

 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.   EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN   WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY        AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU        FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

GNU ARM Eclipse

GNU ARM Eclipse was obtained from http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/gnuarmeclipse/
and is subject to the Eclipse Public License which is reproduced below.

Eclipse Public License -v 1.0 

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. 

1. DEFINITIONS 

"Contribution" means: 

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and 

b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 

i) changes to the Program, and 

ii) additions to the Program; 

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. 

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program. 

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program. 

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement. 

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors. 

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS 

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. 

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. 

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program. 

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. 

3. REQUIREMENTS 

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that: 

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and 

b) its license agreement: 

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; 

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; 

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and 

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. 

When the Program is made available in source code form: 

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and 

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. 

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program. 

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. 

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION 

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. 

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 

5. NO WARRANTY 

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

7. GENERAL 

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. 

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. 

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive. 

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. 

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

Iconfinder Basic 

Iconfinder Basic was obtained from http://support.iconfinder.com/ownership-and-licenses/license-basic and is subject to the Iconfinder Basic License which is reproduced below.


License

This is a legal agreement between you, the Purchaser, and the Licensor (Iconfinder ApS). Purchasing or downloading of any icon or icons set (Licensed Material), constitutes your acceptance of the terms of this agreement if it is clearly noted that the Basic license applies for the specific purchase.

Grant of rights

The standard license grants you, the Purchaser, a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the Licensed Material. The Licensed Material is permitted to be used:
•	For any personal, commercial, editorial or client purpose
•	In an altered, cropped or otherwise modified or manipulated way
The Licensed Material may be reproduced in:

•	Printed Material
•	Advertisements
•	Packaging
•	Presentations
•	Video
•	On-line content
•	Computer games
•	Multimedia projects
•	Smartphone and desktop apps - both free and paid.

Restrictions

All ownership and copyright of the Licensed Material remain the property of licensor. The licensed Material is not being sold, but provided to the purchaser under the terms of this agreement.

The Licensed Material or any derivative work based on the Licensed Material may not be directly or indirectly licensed, sublicensed, sold, resold or redistributed alone - even for free.

The Licensed Material may not be placed:

•	On any website in a complete or archived downloadable format
•	On any electronic bulletin board or downloadable format
•	In a way that enables it to be distributed in any other way
The Licensed Material may not be:

•	Sold or redistributed as part of an icon set
•	Included in work intended to be reproduced by third party for example:any electronic, web, design or presentation template
•	Incorporated into a logo or other trademark
•	Used on physical items for resale or on any similar mass produced item
•	Used to create pornographic, libellous, obscene or defamatory Material.

Examples

The following examples, on how not to use icons purchased under the Basic lincense, are based on frequently asked questions from other users.

You may not resell the icons

When you buy an icon, you gain the rights to use it in commercial and non-commercial projects. 
You can use it for your own or your client's website, app, presentation etc. However, the Basic license does not give your the rights to resell the icons as a product. You cannot download icons from Iconfinder.com and put them up on your own site for sale.

Icons cannot be resold as part of mass distributed digital products

When you buy an icon, you gain the rights to use it in commercial and non-commercial projects. 
You can use it for your own or your client's website, app, presentation etc. You are, for example, free to use the icons in a SaaS analytics dashboard product you sell to customers. But, you cannot use the icons in a dashboard Bootstrap UI theme, you sell on a theme marketplace. The 
Basic license does not give you the rights to resell the icons as part of digital products like:

•	Themes
•	UI-kits
•	Software frameworks
•	In-app purchase icon packs
Icons cannot be used on merchandise for sale

Using icons on T-shirts and other types of physical products is fine, but reselling these products is not permitted. You can print an icon on a T-shirt for your self, a client or for internal use in your company. But you are not allowed to print an icon on a shirt and then resell the shirt as a product. The reason is that as soon as the icon becomes the main motif on the shirt, cup or whatever item you had in mind, it goes from being an icon to being a new product in itself.

In many ways icons are like logos. The artwork is simple and elegant, and often has a very clear and easy to understand meaning. Neither the Extended license nor the Basic license permit the icons to be used as logos. Your logo has to be unique, otherwise it cannot be trademarked. Also, if you try to trademark a logo that is an icon, the designer of the icon can have a conflicting copyright ownership. We therefore do not allow the usage of the Licensed material as logos.
